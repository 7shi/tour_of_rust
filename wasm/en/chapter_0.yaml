    Welcome to the *Tour of WebAssembly*. This is meant to be a introduction to
    the technology 

    and how Rust can be used to power the web.  If you are completely new to
    Rust, you might 

    appreciate the [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/)! Most of our examples
    will be easy

    enough to follow along by anyone though. This tour is also available in C.
