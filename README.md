Welcome to the source repo of [Tour of Rust](https://richardanaya.github.io/tour_of_rust/).

# Looking for translators!

If you would like to contribute translations in a language that doesn't exist yet.  Feel free to make an issue and I will modify the generator for your language.

Adding new languages should be as simple as adding new title/content properties to the lessons.json per lesson postfixed with the appropriate language code. i.e. "content_es".

# Credit

This tutorial format and many of the examples were inspired by the wonderful [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)
